    Our Area mobile service has several routes.

    The first route is to allow users to identify themselves.
    To do this, they can either connect with their accounts that have been created beforehand by their care,
    and saved in our database.
    For new users, they can identify themselves by creating an account,
    which will then be saved in our database.

    The second route is the homepage of our website.
    This page contains the Area created beforehand by the user who is stored on his account in our database.
    This page may also contain the future Area that the user can create afterwards.
    In addition, the user has the possibility to log out.

    Finally, on this page, the user has access to a button that will redirect it to another page, designed for the creation of an Area.
    The last route is the Area creation page.
    The user has the option to choose a first service.
    Then choose a second service. Subsequently, the user will choose from all the triggers offered,
    to choose one of the many actions made available.
    Finally, it will be able to finalize this Area, which will appear on the home page of the user.

    The user can interact with each services which are called "ACTION" and cause "REACTION" in Gmail/Discord/Outlook.
